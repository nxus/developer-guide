# Getting Started

Welcome to Nxus! This getting started guide will show you how to create your first Nxus application.

Nxus is designed to be three things:

* **Efficient**: a well designed API that means you write fewer lines of code.
* **Modular**: a library of common features and tools so you don't have to write it.
* **Flexible**: install only what you need, no bloat.

## About this Guide
The best way to learn Nxus is to build a Nxus app. This guide will walk you through the basic steps of creating a web application from scratch using the core Nxus modules. By the end, you will have a good understand of how Nxus works and a solid foundation to explore more specialized topics like [building a Nxus module](/creating_a_module) and building [data processors]().

## Requirements
In order to follow this guide, you'll need a few things first.

1. NodeJS. Nxus requires Node v 6.4 or above.  You can download NodeJS from the [project page](http://www.nodejs.org) or via a tool like [homebrew](http://brew.sh).
2. NPM. You'll need npm v 3.0 or above. This usually comes with NodeJS so no extra install necessary.
3. Git. You probably already have this, but you'll want to have Git v 2.4 or above.
4. A text editor.  We like [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) but any text editor will do.
