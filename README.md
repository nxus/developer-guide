# Nxus Developer Guide

This is the guide for using Nxus and developing Nxus applications and modules.

## What is Nxus?

Nxus is a NodeJS framework for building data driven applications quickly. Nxus is modular, and includes all of the tools and features you'll need to create a modern web app, including user management, administration, templates, storage, and data processing.

## Why Nxus?

We built Nxus for three reasons. 

First, we wanted to write fewer lines of code, and craved a well constructed API that balanced the need for creativity and flexibility with automation and sane default functionality.  Our mantra is *it should work great out of the box, and I can easily customize it if I want.*

Second, we wanted a library of features we could re-use without having to build yet another *\<fill in common feature\>*.

Third, we wanted a lightweight, dynamic framework that could be customized with as much or as little as we required for a particular application.

## Requirements

In order to run Nxus applications, you'll need the following:

* Git v 2.6 or above
* NodeJS v 6.4 or above
* NPM v 3.0 or above

Optionally, you'll likely want:

* A persistent database (MongoDB is one of the defaults)
