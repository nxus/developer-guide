# Creating an App
First, we'll need to create a new folder to house our application. 

```
> mkdir myApp
```

Alternatively, Nxus provides a number of boilerplate application examples you can use that come preconfigured:

* [Basic app boilerplate](https://github.com/nxus/app-boilerplate)
* [Web app boilerplate](https://github.com/nxus/web-app-boilerplate)
* [Module boilerplate](https://github.com/nxus/module-boilerplate)

But since this guide is about using Nxus from the ground up, we'll start with a bare repo.

## Setting up NPM
Next, we'll need to initialize our new folder with NPM in order to create a `package.json` file.

```
> npm init
```

Follow the prompts and then confirm.  Now you should see a `package.json` in your application folder.
